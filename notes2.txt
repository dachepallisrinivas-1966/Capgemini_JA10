                                ===============
HTML 5
---------------------------------
HyperText Markup Language

Hypertext : Plain Text + Hylerlinks + Audio + Video + images

HTML TAG
    <p>, <h1>, <a>, <div>, <img>
HTML ELEMENT
    <p>This is a paragraph</p>

<!DOCTYPE html> - it is also known as PI ( ??? )

    <header>
    <section>
    <footer>
    <nav>
    <article>

html elements are of 2 types.
1) block elements       <h1>, <p>, <div>
2) inline elements      <span>, <b>, <i>

<h1>this is heading-1</h1>
<h2>this is heading-2</h2>

images:
--------
never use "height" attribute.
because if we specify width, the height is adjusted proportionately.

anchor tags:
-----------------
<a
href        hyperlink reference


lists:
------
ordered  <ol>, <li>     (numbered list)
    type="" I, i, A, a
unordered <ul>          (bulleted list)
    type="square | circle | disc"
<ol>
    <li>java</li>
    <li>python</li>
    <li>ruby</li>
    <li>c#</li>
</ol>


design a web page that show the following output.

<caption> : table caption

HTML 5 offer semantic tags:
-------------------------------
<thead>
<tfoot>
<tbody>
instead of <b>, use <strong> tag
instead of <i>, use <em> tag    (em stands for emphasize)

attributes:
-----------
border
width
align

cellpadding
cellspacing

HTML Entities:
---------------
&#8377;     (for INR)



comments:
-------------
<!--
    write any 
    comment in
    many lines also
-->


images:
------------
<img />
src
width
height      (NOT RECOMMEDED)

Entire web page is designed using <table> tags.
However this is not STANDARD.
Instead of <table>, use always <div> tag.


<div>       is a BLOCK element
<p>         is a BLOCK element
<span>      is an Inline element

colspan attribute : to merge columns
rowspan attribute : to merge rows


frameset, frame
    one web page can be divided into multiple parts.
    each part is known as frame.
    collection of frames is known as frameset.
    in one frame, we can display one web page (.html)

    but this is a deprecated.
    instead of use div.

iframe
    internal frame.
    this is again a standard.
    in one iframe, we can display a page, we can play an audio, video etc.,


form controls
    form
    input
        type="text | password | number | date | time | email | file"

    <input type="submit" value="Save" />
    <input type="reset" value="Reset" />

    button
        type="submit"
        type="button"
        type="reset"

    check boxes
        <input type="checkbox" />
    radio buttons
        <input type="radio" />

    drop down list          (allow us to choose only one item)
        <select>
        </select>
    list                    (to select multiple items)
        <select>
        </select>

    file upload control
        input type="file"

        validation attributes
            required
            min
            max
            pattern

                            CSS - 3
                            =======
                            
It stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
It is a language that can define the appearance of an HTML element.
There are three different ways to apply styling to an HTML page.
1) In-line styles
    It is applied for each element using it's style attribute.
    <tagName style="css-property:value; css-property:value;">
        TagContent
    </tagName>


    CSS Properties:
    ------------------------------------------------
    width               pixels. precentages, mm, cms
    height
    margin
    padding
    border

    color               colorName, hexaCode (#000000 - #FFFFFF)
    background-color

    text-align
    font-family
    font-weight

2) Embedding styles
    CSS style is written in <style> </style> element.
    <style></style> is defined in <head></head>.

    <html>
        <head>
            <style>
                selector {
                    css-property : value;
                }
            </style>
        </head>
        <body>
        </body>
    </html>

    what are selectors?
    -------------------
    selector is a simple string that can select a group of elements to which the 
    style has to be appplied.

    there are FIVE (5) types.
    1. Tag name selector
            the name of the tag act as a selector.
            so that all elements with that tag name is applied with style defined.

            p {
                text-align : center;
            }

    2. Attribute selector
            these are used to group elements by it's attribute.
            attribute must be placed in [ ] square brackets.

            [type] {
                width: 200px;
            }
            
    3. Class selector
            class is a user-defined string, that can applied as class attribute to all those tags to which 
            we wish to apply a style.
            class selector must be defined with .   (dot)

            .imp {
                text-decoration : underline;
            }

            <p class=".imp"></p>
    
    4. ID selector
            is used to apply a style to one particular element, which has refererd by this id.
            id selector must be defined wuth # (hash)

            #tagId {
                border : 1px;
            }

    5. pseudo selector

        we will discuss these selectors.



    CSS Selector Operators:
    -----------------------
    s1 , s2     applies to elements that match both selectors
    s1   s2     applies to all elements that match s2 and are inside s1
    s1 > s2     applies to all elements that match s2 whose parent is s1
    s1 + s2     applies to all elements that match s2 and are immediately after s1
    s1 ~ s2     applies to every element that match s2 and is preceded by s1

            applies to all elements that have
            ---------------------------------
    [s1]            s1 as attribute
    [s1 = 'v1']     s1 attribute with value v1
    [s1 ~= 'v1']  (or)  [s1 *= 'v1']
                    s1 attribute contains word v1  (same as above - these are TWO ways)
    [s1 != 'v1']    s1 attribute not equal to  v1
    [s1 ^= 'v1']    s1 attribute starts with the word v1
    [s1 $= 'v1']    s1 attribute ends with the word v1

    pseudo selectors
    ----------------
    input:enabled       selects every enabled <input> element
    p:first-child       selects every <p> element that is the first child of it's parent
    p:first-letter      selects the first=letter of every <p> element
    p:first-line        selects the first-line of every <p> element
    p:first-of-type     selects every <p> element that is the first <p> element of its parent
    
    input:focus         selects the input element which has focus
    a:hover             selects link on mouse over
    
    input:in-range      selects input elements with a value within a specified range
    input:indeterminate selects input elements that are in an indeterminate state
    input:invalid       selects all input elements with an invalid value
    input:optional      selects all input elements with no "required" attribute

    p:last-child        select every <p> element that is the last child of it's parent
    p:last-of-type      select every <p> element that is the last <p> element of it's parent

    a:link              select all unvisited links
    :not(p)             select every element that is not <p> elements
    p:nth-child(2)      select all <p> elements that is 2nd child of it's parent
    p:nth-last-child(2) select all <p> elements that is 2nd last child of it's parent



3) External styles
    styles are defined in a separate ".css" file.
    this file is linked in html file using <link> tag inside <head> section.
    so that those styles are applied in that html file.    

                                                Bootstrap 4
                                                ------------
    Bootstrap is a CSS library.
    contain lot many pre-defined css classes.
    we can customize these classes also.

    It offer Grid system.
    Page can be divided into rows and columns.
    each row can accomodate 12 columns.
    one cell can occupy more than one column as well.
    each row is represented by a class called "row".
    each col is idenetified by a class called "col-colType-colSize"

    colType 
        xs      extra small
        sm      small
        md      medium
        lg      large
    eg:
        col-xs-3
        col-lg-1

    How to integrate Bootstrap?
        it contain bootstrap-4.min.css
        we can download this file from bootstrap web site
        (or)
        we can use CDN (content delivery network)
        refer this file in <link> tag.

    1) html 5 doctype
    2) use lang attribute and set it to english
    3) also do set the char set.
    4) mobile first approach
    thus add the view port conf as meta tag.

    bootstrap container classes
        .container          creates a fixed width container
        .container-fluid    creates a full fixed width container

                                    ES6 (ECMA Script 6)
                                    ===================

browser has a javascript engine (V6 engine) that executes your java script code.
Java script is a client side scripting language.
Java script also support server side scripting.

MEAN Stack 
    Mongo DB (No SQL Database)
    Express JS (server server script)
    Angular (client side )
    Node    (runtime environment)

MERN Stack
    Mongo DB (No SQL Database)
    Express JS (server server script)
    React JS (client side )
    Node    (runtime environment)

we can execute javascript program on NODE.
any javascript program  should be saved with an extension ".js" (external)
you can write javascript program inside the HTML also.
variable declaration is always optional.
javascript is type-less.
javascript is dynamic.

In javascript functions are treated as FIRST CLASS CITIZENS.

functions
    no params no return type
    have params no return type
    hava params have return type

1) we can pass a function-name as parameter to another function.
2) we can return a function from another function.



we can assign a variable to a function definition.

var a = function () {
        return "hello";    
}

a();
